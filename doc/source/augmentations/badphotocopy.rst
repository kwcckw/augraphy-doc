Overview
--------
There are 4 main types of noise in BadPhotoCopy augmentation:

Noise type 1 creates even spread of noises. 
Noise type 2 creases noises with regular patterns
Noise type 3 creates noises in all borders of image.
Noise type 4 creates sparse and little noises.

Initially, a clean image with single line of text is created.

    # import libraries
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    from augraphy import *
    
    
    # create a clean image with single line of text
    image = np.full((500, 1500,3), 255, dtype="uint8")
    cv2.putText(
        image,
        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit",
        (80, 250),

        1.5,

---------
Example 1
---------
In this example, a BadPhotoCopy augmentation instance is initialized with noise type of 1 and the noise is set at the left edge of the image. Noise concentation is set to low intensity (0.2, 0.3) and noise sparsity is set to a low value (0.15, 0.15). Augmentation is set to run with 2 to 3 iterations and each time the noise size is randomly set from 2 to 3. Flag to blur noise is set to random (-1). 

::

    BadPhotoCopy_type_1 = BadPhotoCopy(noise_type=1,
                                       noise_side="left",
                                       noise_iteration=(2,3),
                                       noise_size=(2,3),

---------
Example 2
---------
In this example, a BadPhotoCopy augmentation instance is initialized with noise type of 2 and the noise is set at the right edge of the image. Noise concentation is set to low intensity (0.5, 0.5) and noise sparsity is set to a medium value (0.2, 0.3). Augmentation is set to run with 2 to 3 iterations and each time the noise size is randomly set from 2 to 3. Flags to blur noise and edge effect in noise are enabled.

    BadPhotoCopy_type_2 = BadPhotoCopy(noise_type=2,
                                       noise_side="right",

Example 3
---------
In this example, a BadPhotoCopy augmentation instance is initialized with noise type of 3. Noise concentation is set to medium intensity (0.5, 0.5) and noise sparsity is set to a low value(0.2, 0.3). Augmentation is set to run with 2 to 3 iterations and each time the noise size is randomly set from 1 to 3. Flag to blur noise is enabled and flag for edge effet is set to random (-1).
